"Balloon Popper"

My final greenfoot project game is called "Balloon Popper", this is because you  will be in space popping balloons to gain points. To 
start,  you can  either head into the rules page first to refresh the rules or hop right into the game. By running the program, 
you  can hit space or left  your your mouse. Hitting space will allow you to head to the rules/instructions page while left  clicking
your mouse will send  you straight to the game. Be careful, because once you start the game, balloons and bombs will start heading your
way. As the spaceship spawns on the  left, you can use 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd'  to control the spaceships movements. You can move up 
down left and right with these keys. The last  mechanic for the spaceship is that if you left click, you will shoot out a energy ball
that will move directly to the right of your spaceship's position. This energy ball is so strong will remove any obstacle  in it's way.

Obstacles: Red Balloon, Yellow Balloon, Blue Balloon, and big Bomb

Four obstacles will be spawning on the right of the game as they travel to the left side of the screen. The spaceship's job is to gather 
as much energy as possible by blowing up balloons. Yellow balloons give the most energy, 3 points of energy, Blue balloons giving 2 points
of energy and Red balloons giving only 1 point of energy. However, although you can get all these points of energy, you can easily lose 
your points if you hit the Big Bomb. Each big bomb will explode on its hit with the energy ball, it shakes the spaceship and takes 
half  of the gained points away from the balloons. 

How the game  ends:

The  game ends when  all  3 of  your balloons successfully make it to the left side of the game before  you hit them. They do not respawn
after they reach the end so  you  will lose out on a lot of points. Your score will  display at the very end of the game.

How to  reach end game screen: Just play the game  and do not do anything, if you want to go even faster you can make the speed much higher
in a way that it makes the game over screen appear faster
PRO TIP: DON'T HIT THE BOMB  EVEN IF IT  COST ONE OF YOUR BALLOONS!
